title: Setting up a Cloud9 workspace
---

Cloud 9 is a development environment - in the cloud. Cloud9 combines a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu workspace in the cloud. If you want to code and enjoy coding, then Cloud9 is the perfect place for you. Cloud9 offers everything you need for coding right there in front of you!  

### Cloud 9 Setup
In order to use the services of Cloud9 you must first [log-in/sign-up](http://c9.io).

### Creating a new workspace
After you sign up and login, then you must select "Create a new Workspace" - shown below.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/newWork.png)  

After you select that you will be prompted with a new page with many different text boxes to fill in about the type of workspace you're going to create. The text boxes are pre-filled with the information that you must put into each of them - shown below.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/createWork.png)  

After you put in your workspaces name and description (optional) you can then select whether you want your workspace to be public or private. Since you are more than likely going to be a free user you are only allowed to have **ONE** private workspace so please choose wisely. You can also clone a github repository onto a Cloud9 workspace. All of which is shown below.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pubPriv.png)  

Once you have completed that you will be one step away from successfully creating a new workspace. The last step is fairly simple and you must select from the many templates exactly which one you want. If you have made it this far then I am sure that you know what type of workspace you would like to create, but if you don't there is always the option of creating a blank workspace. Which is the only type of workspace I have created and it is also the only workspace that we used in my Application of Databases class.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/template.png)  

After you select your template and select the "Create Workspace" button you should then be prompted with this page.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/load.png)  

After the loading page goes away your workspace will appear - shown below.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/beginningScreen.png)  
  
* Your folders will be to your left, your opened files will be in the middle, and your terminal will be below that.  
  
Hopefully this will help you get started.  
Have fun coding!
