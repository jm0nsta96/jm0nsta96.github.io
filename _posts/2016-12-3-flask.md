title: Getting Started with Flask
---

* Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
* There are a few different things that you can create with Flask.  
  
* The two main things that we created in my Application of Databases class using flask are:
    * Web Apps
    * Dynamic Websites  
  

### Installing Flask
You must type in this line of code on the command line:
* sudo easy_install flask markdown

### Simple Flask Server Code
This is the most basic code that we learned at the beginning of the semester for this class, and it can easily be used and manipulated.
