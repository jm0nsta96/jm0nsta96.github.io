### PostgreSQL Thoughts
I feel as though the postgres section of this class, and the majority of the sql topics that we worked with were pretty easy. I feel as though the syntax for postgres was really easy to understand and learn. I think that the book, Head First SQL, was very well written and it was the perfect book for us beginners to learn from. Overall, I really enjoyed the postgres section of this class and trying to figure out different queries to help solve the different databases questions that our professor gave us.
