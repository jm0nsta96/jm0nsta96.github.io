title: My takeaways from my Application of Databases class here at UMW
---

### PostgreSQL Thoughts
I feel as though the postgres section of this class, and the majority of the sql topics that we worked on were pretty easy. I feel as though the syntax for postgres was really easy to understand and learn. I think that the book, Head First SQL, was very well written and it was the perfect book for us beginners to learn from. Overall, I really enjoyed the postgres section of this class and trying to come up with different queries to help solve the different databases questions that our professor gave us.

### HTML Thoughts
I feel as though the HTML section of this class was not too hard to understand. There is a lot of information on the internet about HTML and I found [Google Search](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=html%20help) to be very helpful throughout the entire semester.

### Python Thoughts
I thought...

### SocketIO Thoughts
I most definitely believe that the SocketIO section of this class was the most difficult part of this class. I did end up completing both parts of our main SocketIO assignment, but it was very difficult. I had trouble with the linking of the different files. Trying to connect the python with the javascript and the HTML was pretty difficult to understand, in my opinion.  
* If you plan on doing any SocketIO stuff in the future make sure you know what you are doing!

### Overall Thoughts
Although I did take my professors advice and I tried to learn HTML and Python over the summer. I still feel as though I struggled a lot in this class, because everything was so brand new to me and I was trying to learn so many different languages at once. Before this class I had never worked with Python, HTML, Postgres or any type of SQL Query Language, or with building websites or applications. I feel like I should have waited and taken this class after going through a few more courses here at the university, especially CPSC 348 â€“ Web Application Development.
