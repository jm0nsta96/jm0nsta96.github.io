title: My takeaways from my Application of Databases class here at UMW

### PostgreSQL Thoughts
I feel as though the postgres section of this class, and the majority of the sql topics that we worked on were pretty easy. I feel as though the syntax for postgres was really easy to understand and learn. I think that the book, Head First SQL, was very well written and it was the perfect book for us beginners to learn from. Overall, I really enjoyed the postgres section of this class and trying to come up with different queries to help solve the different databases questions that our professor gave us.

### HTML Thoughts
I thought...

### Python Thoughts
I thought...

### SocketIO Thoughts
I thought...

### Overall Thoughts
Although I did take my professors advice and I tried to learn HTML and Python over the summer. I still feel as though I struggled a lot in this class, because everything was so brand new to me and I was trying to learn so many different languages at once. Before this class I had never worked with Python, HTML, Postgres or any type of SQL Query Language, or with building websites or applications. I feel like I should have waited and taken this class after going through a few more courses here at the university, especially CPSC 348 â€“ Web Application Development.
