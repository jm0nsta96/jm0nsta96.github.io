title: PostgreSQL Commands
---

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.  

### PostgreSQL
There are a few common commands in postgres that are really good to know in order to use and manipulate databases. These commands can help you a lot in the long run when it comes to trying to understand database systems.

### PostgreSQL Commands
For most of these I will give a short explanation in my own words, but most of the screenshots will do a lot of the teaching/talking.  
  
First command - Create Database - this command is essential in database design, and it does exactly what the name says.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/6.png)  
  
Second command - \l - this command lists all of the databases that were created within your particular PostgreSQL Database.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/7.png)  
  
Third command - \d - this command is very essential once you start creating tables in PostgreSQL, but it simply lists out all of the tables that you have created within your particular PostgreSQL Database.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/10.png)  
  
Fourth command - Drop Database - this command drops or deletes any database that you tell it to.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/8.png)  
  
Fifth command - \? - this command is very flexible as you can see in the screenshot, but basically it is the help command. You can type in \h create and it will show you help about all of the commands that start with create in PostgreSQL.  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/9.png)  

### Conclusion
PostgreSQL is very reliable tool in terms to database systems in my opinion, but it can also be a bit tricky so knowing some of the above commands can help you a lot in the long run of trying to understand postgreSQL and database systems in general.  
This is just some of the common commands that you can use in postgres to help get you started. There are many more where that came from. Especially when it comes to creating tables and manipulating those tables within your database. For more information on those please visit this [site](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql.html).  
Also, in order to use these commands you must first install postgres onto your terminal or download it some other way. For more informaton on that please click the following [link](http://jm0nsta96.github.io/postgresSetup)
