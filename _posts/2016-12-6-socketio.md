title: Starting AngularJS and Flask-SocketIO
---

SocketIO was by far the hardest rudiment/project that we had to do for my Application of Databases class here at UMW. This rudiment was all about creating a chatroom and being able to broadcast to different people who are logged in to your chatroom.  
There is a lot more that comes along with SocketIO coding, but I just wanted to use this blog post as a chance to help get you started.

### SocketIO Setup
In order to do anything with SocketIO you must first type this command into your terminal:  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/socket.png)  
After you have typed in this command you can now code things using SocketIO.  
  
With AngularJS and Flask-SocketIO you will need to have a Javascript file, a python file and an HTML file. All of these files will be connected someway in creating whatever you need in SocketIO.  
  
I could sit here and explain to you everything I know about AngularJS and Flask-SocketIO, but I would rather you see and hear it from a professional coder.  
Here are the [notes](https://github.com/zacharski/cs350Notes#video-12-socketio-part-1-angularjs-and-flask-socketio-1), [video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cQFzc_Zo8M&list=PLuZfoSIficQvVN44F1emhKAF-1KIoRcok&index=12), and [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0-TxylCBnY&list=PLuZfoSIficQvVN44F1emhKAF-1KIoRcok&index=13) from my professor who did an amazing job at explaining everything he knows about AngularJS and Flask-SocketIO.  
  
Hopefully the notes and videos helped.  
Have fun coding!
