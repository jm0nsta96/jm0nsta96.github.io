I am currently attending the University of Mary Washington trying to obtain my degree in computer science. I really enjoy sports.
Especially basketball and football. If I had to choose one though it would definitely be basketball.

### More Information

Although I have been at Mary Washington for 3 years, I feel as though I am still very new to the computer science world... 
I started off wanting to be an architectural engineer all throughout high school, but once I took an architectural class during my senior year I realized that probably wasn't going to be the best choice for me.
I always knew that computers were a really big thing in today's society and that computer science or something very similar was what many
people were...
