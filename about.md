I am currently attending the University of Mary Washington trying to obtain my degree in computer science. 

### My personal life

* I am a middle child of four children - one brother and two sisters.
* I am a first generation college student.

### How I chose computer science

Although I have been at Mary Washington for 3 years, I feel as though I am still very new to the computer science world... 
I started off wanting to be an architectural engineer all throughout high school, but once I took an architectural class during my senior year I realized that probably wasn't going to be the best choice for me.
I always knew that computers were a really big thing in today's society and that computer science or something very similar was what most
people were telling me I should try out since I am really good at math. Now that I have taken a few courses I believe that I made the wise choice.

* In the end, I don't know if programming is the route for me, but it is definitely a great thing to have to lean on.
* I feel as though I will probably end up going more down the 'computer networking' career path.

### Experience

* I have experience in writing in a multitude of languages.
    * I have written code in Java, JavaScript, C++, HTML, Python, PostgreSQL, etc.
    * I have created a few static websites and applications.
    * I have created many different databases and written a multitude of queries to go along with them.
    * I have worked with Flask and SocketIO.
    * I am well versed with the terminal.
* I have done a computer science related internship.
    * I worked with the networking department and completed numerous tasks over a 90+ day period.
    * I can provide more information upon request.

### Random Facts

* I really enjoy sports - Especially basketball and football. 
* If I had to choose one though it would definitely be basketball.
* I am a huge Dallas Cowboys fan.
* I am also a lifetime Cleveland Cavaliers fan (not just a Lebron fan).
* I am also a Texas Longhorns fan for all college sports.
* I enjoy playing video games and watching sports.
